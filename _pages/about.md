# ACTIVITIES

## TEAM ACTIVITIES
*August 2023*  Participated in **2023 IEEE 4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML 2023)** and made oral presentation of my research paper. I won the **Best Presentation Award** in the session of Computer Vision and Recognition. #E13
(PRML is an annual conference which aims to present the latest research and results of scholars and experts related to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Conference URL: http://www.prml.org/index.html)

*July 2022-Nov 2022*	Selected for the **2022 Rhino-Bird Middle School Science Research Training Program** (with a total of 29 projects nation-wide, hosted by Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua university and Tencent Company), within 5 months, I completed my research project, Intelligent Recognition System for smartphone phubber based on Pose Classification and Object Detection Algorithm, and won **Outstanding prize in the finals(ranking national 7th place)**. #E8

*August 2022*	Selected for **2022 Tencent Rhinoceros Bird Elite Camp**, I studied courses including artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision, etc., and conducted on-site model training experiments and competitions. #E14

*August 2021*	Selected for the **2021 Youth AI Future Summer Camp** jointly organized by Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, SenseTime Company (one of the best AI companies in China), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (a total of 23 students). My research project, clean-plates action in AI canteen, achieved a score of A+ in the final assessment.  #E15

## SOCIAL ACTIVITYES
**2022-2023  "Tongshu Reading Club" public welfare project**  #E17

In 2022, I initiated the "Tongshu Reading Club" community service project named after my name and formed a team of three core members and more than ten volunteers. In order to keep left-behind children in rural regions away from smartphones, "Tongshu Reading Club" raised over 40000 RMB of public welfare funds in past two years, selected and purchased over 3000 high-quality books suitable for children and teenagers, and established libraries for three schools in minority areas of Yunnan province, benefiting over 2000 students.
